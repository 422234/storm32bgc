v0.33:
 - suggestion: GUI: rc pitch range extended to +-120° (hexakopter/Dario)
 - input_getfunctionvalues(), input_changevirtualconfiguration() simplified
 - Setup parameters deleted: RcMidMode, RcRate, RcExpo, Setup parameters rearranged, mavlink cmds rearranged
 - extend calibration time to 2secs to allow AHRS to settle, shortened AHRS T to 0.1f and 10.0f
 - do overall acc normalization at calibration, this doesn't do much however
 - AUX2 handling for v1.3 boards added, AUX01_PUSH, AUX012_PUSH added
VERSION RELEASED as version v0.33 on 19.June.2014
v0.34:
 - amplitude in auto motor direction detection increased
 - level detection improved, uses filtered angle
 - suggestion: GUI: write+store in IMU and motor configuration tabs (yang/wdaehn/Werner)
v0.35:
 - suggestion: GUI: disable/enable handling for some functions (yang/wdaehn/Werner)
 - suggestion: renamed and "press","push" to "switch","latched" (LoneStriker/irun4fundotca)
 - meaning of IMU2 Configuration changed
 - gyro filter added, Setup.GyroLPF
 - Setup.GimbalConfiguration changed to Setup.SafteyConfiguration
 - handling of some Setup settings via IS_ macros
v0.36:
 - bug: error in orientation_from_angles() for yaw<>0 corrected, didn't affect previous firmware versions
 - bug: angle overturn calculation was incorrect
 - GUI: yaw offset range changed to +-30°, offset step 0.5°, angle plot +-200°, debug info in read/write removed
 - input debounce range for +250 state changed to +223...+277
 - use of ALLAXES macro in live data, safes a lot
 - do angle overturn calculation for pitch&yaw
 - 2nd IMU support
v0.37:
 - bugs: 2:yaw pan by 180° yields pan steps, 4:yaw1,2 run crazy after long while (hexakopter/Dario) -> handle +-180° thing in imu_Mahony for YawAngleTarget and _YawAngle
 - bug: motorusage != normal -> set also pid Cntrl to zero
 - bug: i2c_enforcerecover() also for 2nd IMU
 - SETUP_OffsetXXX not needed
 - reset imu then orientation is changed (not very important, with USB only LEVEL is reached and then time constant is fast)
 - rename MAVLINK_CMD_SETAUXKEYS to MAVLINK_CMD_ACTIVEPANMODESETTING
 - motor usage = disabled as default
v0.38:
 - removed using _StartupOscillationDetectionThreshold
 - YawT for yaw2 set to 400, YaT for yaw1 re-enabled
 - level pitch&roll max set to 120°,75°
VERSION RELEASED as version v0.38e on 10.Aug.2014
v0.39:
 - bug: in _imu_do_lpf4imusensor()
 - bug: CntrlI rollover by 360° (or maybe 180°), not fpoleangle
 - bug: MotorPos limit to +-30000 removed
 - GUI: pitch and roll offset limited to +-5°, 0.05° steps (yaw offset range should remain large)
 - motor poles = 14 as default
 - feedforward: smooth handling of changes in feedforward gain and/or imu2 configuration
 - Imu2Params handling modified
 - signs in PID control loop changed
 - calibration commands and functions implemented
 - serial cmd stores calib data in Setup&EEPROM, but gzero is not activated (keep startup values)
 - startup calibration data in separate structure, acc startup calib not used
 - GUI: Calibrate Acc tab
VERSION RELEASED as version v0.39e on 18.Aug.2014
v0.40:
 - bug: in feedforward (hexakopter/Dario)
 - oscillation detection
VERSION RELEASED as version v0.40e on 24.Aug.2014
v0.41:
 - bug: end of relevel detection corrected
 - PanExpo for soft limiting pan
 - RcHysteresis
 - RcOffset, replaces Offset and in fact does it better, Offset now only for level adjustment, works with relevel
VERSION RELEASED as version v0.41e on 26.Aug.2014
v0.42:
 - fixed point q (see also http://www.olliw.eu/2014/fast-functions/)(110us instead of 250 us)
 - fixed point AHRs params
 - fixed point A,R,G (70us)
 - YawT scale changed, fixed point YawT, renaming to f
 - fixed point tIMUSensor,
 - fixed point _imu_confidence, further little improvements in imu code
 - setup_handle_calibration_change() without intermediate float
 - better code for (s16)(10000.0f*q24_to_float(f))
v0.43:
 - pid control structure: new axis mixing algorithm, pan mechanism, motor predictor, yaw2 predictor; solves also these bugs:
 - bug: 90°yaw then phh and pitch, yields pitch pan errors (hexakopter/Dario)
 - bug: yaw pan, and the "pitch" along stick yields roll error (careyer/Thomas)
 - oscillation detection moved to later
 - acc method advanced as default
 - UART3 remapped changed to UART4
 - green led debug mode
VERSION RELEASED as version v0.43e on 20.Sep.2014
v0.44:
 - bug: standby, s32
 - bug: RcOffset were not set
 - bug: Imu2 offset correction at startup was only for pitch,
 - bug: do Imu2 startup offset correction only for pitch&roll, yaw doesn't work
 - bug gui: COM range extended to 999 (GekoCH/Andy)
 - R2 lpf filter (doesn't seem to do much, though), set to 1 as default
 - fwrap180() for YawT
 - serial moved
 - Imu2 offset startup correction handling improved
 - GyroLPF = 1 as default
 - handling cases then a motor is off, fall back to default
 - handling of IMU2 NOT present in the PID aftermath
v0.45:
 - bug gui: allow up to com999  (GekoCH/Andy)
 - ppm with 12 channels added (GekoCH/Andy)
 - dead-band in pan mode for yaw
 - bug: Gyro2Zero was set to g1zero in serial (as it wasn't used so far, didn't had any impact)
 - bug gui: in 6 point calibration zeros were too large by a factor of 2
 - pid parameters handling faster
 - deadband in panmode for all three axes
v0.46:
 - gui: align yaw axis tool
VERSION RELEASED as version v0.46 on 1.Oct.2014
