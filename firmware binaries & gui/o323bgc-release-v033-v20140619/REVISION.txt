v0.28:
 - suggestion: RcRate is overwritten by RcSpeedLimit (i.e. RcSpeedLimit is used instead), and RcRate is hidden in GUI (yang/Werner)
 - suggestion: mavlink GETDATA command added (hexacopter/Dario)
 - bug: _input_rclpf_Nfilter was not for each axis, changed to proper re-scaling -> _input_Nlast instead
 - acceleration limit devided by 2
 - re-center camera function, also via mavlink commands possible
VERSION RELEASED as version v0.28 on 11.Mai.2014
v0.29:
 - bug: STMFlashLoader --ep added
 - bug: mavlink crc shouldn't include start byte, excluded now !only outgoing messages have crc, no crc check of incoming messages!
 - mavlink command for getting one data value !NOT TESTED!
 - the rc input "noise" filters were removed for RC and POT signals, this is handled well by the accel filter
 - rc trim applies also to joystick inputs
 - auto/calibrate function added for Rc Trim (=Setup.RcMid)
VERSION RELEASED as version v0.29 on 18.Mai.2014
v0.30:
 - VIRTUALCONFIGURATION instead of RC2CONFIGURATION => should be seriously re-tested! (did work for me!)
 - bug: sum-PPM max start length is too short for e.g. Dario (hexacopter/Dario)
 - bug: when virtual Channel Configuration is changed with Virtual selected, change is not taken over
 - GUI: do hAT before NAME change to work also with v1.8 linvor BT modules
 - advanced acc compensation method implemented, along with required setup changes
VERSION distributed as version v0.30e on 24.Mai.2014
v0.31:
 - suggestion: GUI: virtual channel numbering changed to 1...10 (internally the count is still 0...9) (hexacopter/Dario)
 - bug: mavlink getdatafield had wrong cmd id in response, mavlink getdata returned incorrect payload length (Fabio)
 - qmode for motors changed to work for all three axes
VERSION RELEASED as version v0.31 on 28.Mai.2014
v0.32:
 - bug: lipo connect after power up did not work, bug introduced with STATUS_LEVEL_FAILED
 - bug: _lipo_cells determined now only then lipo gets connected
 - bug: setup_set_setup_changed() needed in various commands
 - bug: bug in addressing of buf in setup_copy_parameter_to_buf(), hence mavlink setparameter failed (hexakopter/Dario)
 - bug: CInputFunctionState missed the 7th entry for RECENTERCAMERA (hexakopter/Dario)
 - suggestion: mavlink commands GETVERSION and GETVERSIONSTR added (hexakopter/Dario)
 - several code parts improved for clarity/shortness/efficiency
VERSION distributed as version v0.32e on 15.June.2014
 - bug: in mavlink p>8
 - MAVLINK_ADD_WORD consistently used, ALLFUNCTIONS consistently used
VERSION distributed as version v0.32e02 on 15.June.2014
v0.33:
 - suggestion: GUI: rc pitch range extended to +-120° (hexakopter/Dario)
 - input_getfunctionvalues(), input_changevirtualconfiguration() simplified
 - Setup parameters deleted: RcMidMode, RcRate, RcExpo, Setup parameters rearranged, mavlink cmds rearranged
 - extend calibration time to 2secs to allow AHRS to settle, shortened AHRS T to 0.1f and 10.0f
 - do overall acc normalization at calibration, this doesn't do much however
 - AUX2 handling for v1.3 boards added, AUX01_PUSH, AUX012_PUSH added
